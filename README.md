# LSE_DataAnalyticsUsingPython
This data analysis project uses two data sets containing fictional Covid-19 case and vaccination data to derive insights for a data-driven Vaccination Campaign. The project was awarded a final mark of 82% as part of the London School of Economics Data Analysis Career Accelerator in partnership with FourthRev.

The analysis was carried out in Juypter Notebook using Python. The libraries used in this project are Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation. 

The project required us to determine:
1. Per region, what the vaccination numbers were.
2. Where the campaign should be targeted based on death rates in a region, vaccination uptake per region and recovery numbers per region. 
3. If social media data screen scraped from Twitter would be useful in the campaign. 
4. Which regions have experienced a peak in hospitalisation numbers and there are regions that have not. 

Core Skills Demonstrated:
1. Data Manipulation using Pandas.
2. Visualisation using Seaborn and Pandas.
3. Timeseries analysis.
4. Webscraping.
