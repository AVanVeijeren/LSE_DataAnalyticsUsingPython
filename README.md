# LSE_DataAnalyticsUsingPython
This data analysis project uses two data sets containing fictional Covid-19 case and vaccination data to derive insights for a data-driven Vaccination Campaign. The project was awarded a final mark of 82% as part of the London School of Economics Data Analysis Career Accelerator in partnership with FourthRev.

The analysis was carried out in Juypte Notebook using Python. The libraries used in this project are Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualisation.
